# Week 07 — Lab report

**Name:**
**Group:**
**Date:**

Fill in every section. **Do not delete, rename or renumber the headings.** The checker and the
grader find your answers by them. You can add rows to any table, but never remove its header.

## 1. Setup

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Project I continue (`week-06` = my Week 06 Bolt project, `starter` = the provided starter) | starter |
| Bolt project link (or `not shared`, and why) | not shared, because I did'n do previous practice |
| Assistant that generated the tests (tool) | Claude |
| Exact model (with its version, or `not displayed`) | Sonnet 5.5 |
| Where I ran the tests (Bolt terminal / my computer / Codespace) | my computer |
| Vitest version (the `RUN  v…` line of a run) | |
| Test command | npm test |

---

## 2. Task 1 — baseline and the booking function

**Before editing:** where did the booking decision live in the project you started from?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| File and function (or "inside the page component") | Inside the page component the `check()` function in `src/App.tsx`|
| Its inputs | The start, end and current time converted to minutes, the `blocked` checkbox state and the selected room's `bookings` list |
| What it returned | It set a local variable `ok` |
| How the page used it | `result` decided whether the page showed an "Available" or "Unavailable" message |

**What I changed to extract `canBook`.** Say which file it now lives in, what you moved, and why
the behaviour did not change. Also say which file of the page now calls it. 40 words or more.

<!-- Write below this line -->
I moved the availability decision from the 'check()' function in 'src/App.tsx' into a new file `src/booking.ts` as 'canBook'. I copied the conditions exactly as they were, including their order. `App.tsx` now imports `canBook` and calls it, while the conversion from HH:MM to minutes and the two validation messages stayed in the page. The behaviour did not change. I checked the default 11:00-12:00 request and an overlapping one in the browser before and after
---

## 3. Task 2 — the test plan

Default fixture: `now = 540`, `blocked = false`, `bookings = [{ start: 600, end: 660 }]`, fresh
for every test. **The Expected column comes from AC1–AC4, never from the code.** Write the
**reason** for each expected result **before** you send the generation prompt.

| ID | Candidate / changed input | Expected | AC | Reason (in your words) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T01 | 660–720 (touching after) | true | AC4 | Intervals only touch and the start is after now, duration 60 |
| T02 | 540–570 (starts now) | false | AC1 | The start must be strictly after now and 540 equals now |
| T03 | 720–720 (zero duration) | false | AC1 | The start must be less than end |
| T04 | 750–720 (reversed) | false | AC1 | The end is before the start, which is not a valid interval |
| T05 | 1380–1441 (past day end) | false | AC1 | The day has 1440 minutes, and 1441 is past the end of the day |
| T06 | 720–840 (120 minutes) | true | AC2 | 120 is allowed because it must not exceed|
| T07 | 720–841 (121 minutes) | false | AC2 | 121>120 is not allowed, duration must be not greater than 120 |
| T08 | 570–600 (touching before) | true | AC4 | The request ends at 600, where the booking starts. The end is excluded, so they only touch and 570 is after now |
| T09 | 630–690 (partial overlap) | false | AC4 | 630 is inside 600–660 and the request continues past 660, so the intervals share minutes |
| T10 | 570–690 (contains booking) | false | AC4 | The request starts before the booking and ends after it, so the whole booking is inside the request |
| T11 | 615–645 (inside booking) | false | AC4 | The request lies entirely inside 600–660 |
| T12 | 600–660 (identical interval) | false | AC4 | Duplicate, it covers the same time |
| T13 | 660–720, blocked = true | false | AC3 | Blocked room rejects every request |
| T14 | 630–690, bookings = [] | true | AC4 | Its the same as T09, but bookings is empty, so its okay|
| AC5 | an Available request — the bookings after the call equal the bookings before | true, data unchanged | AC5 | The check only reads the bookings and must never add, remove or change them |
| X1 | 1380–1440 (ends exactly at the end of the day) | true | AC1 | The end value is allowed and the start is after now|
| X2 | 660–700, bookings = [600–660, 700–760] (touches two bookings) | true | AC4 | The request starts where the first booking ends and ends where the second begins. Both ends are excluded, so it fits exactly in the gap |

X1 and X2 are **your own two cases**: a boundary or a state that T01–T14 do not reach. Fill all
five columns.

---

## 4. Task 3 — the generation prompt and the first suite

**The prompt exactly as I sent it.** Use the deck's prompt with `[our test framework]` replaced by
`Vitest`, followed by the case table from section 3:

```text
(paste here)
```

**The assistant's answer: run command, AC mapping and any unclear requirements it flagged,
pasted unedited.** Its test file goes to `suites/first/` and is not pasted here:

```text
(paste here)
```

The first suite was saved to `suites/first/` **before** I changed anything in it: yes / no

---

## 5. Task 4 — review of the first suite

Review it **before** you run it. Look at the imports, the expected values, isolation, duplicates
and skipped tests. Make one row per decision. At least **two** rows, and each one names the kind of
weakness (the deck's table: *no exception occurred* · *expected = current output* · *only valid
requests* · *mocked booking function*, or your own) and the AC that decides it.

| # | Test or part of the suite | What is weak or wrong | Decision: accept / revise / reject | AC or reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | | | accept / revise / reject | |
| 2 | | | accept / revise / reject | |

---

## 6. Task 5 — running, diagnosing, improving

### 6.1 The first run

The **real** terminal output of the first run of the first suite, pasted unedited. Include the
`RUN  v…` line and the `Tests` summary line. A build message or the assistant saying "tests pass"
is not a run.

```text
(paste here)
```

**Each failure, diagnosed** (the deck's table: import/runner error · assertion mismatch · result
changing per run · no tests discovered). Write `none` in the first row if nothing failed.

| Failing test | Observed failure | First check | Test repair or implementation fix? | Action taken |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

### 6.2 The improvement prompt

The deck's improvement prompt exactly as sent, followed by the actual output from 6.1. Then
paste the assistant's answer, unedited:

```text
(paste here)
```

### 6.3 The final run

The **real** output of the final suite (`booking.test.*` beside your module), after every
change and after restoring the correct code from section 7. Every test must pass. If a real defect
is still open, leave its test failing and explain it in 9.1.

```text
(paste here)
```

---

## 7. Task 6 — deliberate defects

You need a reviewed, passing suite first. Then introduce **one** defect at a time in your booking
module, leave the tests unchanged, run, record, and **restore** the code. A syntax or import
error does not count as detection.

| Trial | Intentional change | Detected / Survived | Failing test ID(s) | If it survived: why, and what you added |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Reject duration >= 120 instead of > 120 | Detected / Survived | | |
| M2 | Treat touching endpoints as an overlap | Detected / Survived | | |
| M3 | Remove the blocked-room rejection | Detected / Survived | | |

**The run of each mutant, pasted unedited.** Paste the `Tests` summary line and the failing test
names at least:

```text
(paste here)
```

All three changes reverted, and the full suite run again (section 6.3): yes / no

---

## 8. Task 7 — manual UI checks

Use `now = 09:00` and an existing `10:00–11:00` booking. Do them in the page in a browser. Save a
screenshot of each as `evidence/ui-1.png` … `evidence/ui-5.png`. Take **ui-4 at phone width**
(about 375 px, portrait).

| # | Action | Expected observation | AC | What I observed | Pass / Fail / Not testable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U1 | Check 11:00–12:00, unblocked | Available, with the fixed sample booking | AC5 | | Pass / Fail / Not testable |
| U2 | Enable blocked, then check again | Unavailable replaces the earlier result | AC3, AC5 | | Pass / Fail / Not testable |
| U3 | Clear a required input and submit | Understandable validation feedback | AC6 | | Pass / Fail / Not testable |
| U4 | Use a narrow (phone) width | Controls and result remain usable | AC6 | | Pass / Fail / Not testable |
| U5 | Repeat the checks on the same data | Existing bookings remain unchanged | AC5 | | Pass / Fail / Not testable |

---

## 9. Comparison and what still fails

### 9.1 Checks I am keeping as FAIL or ERROR

Use the same IDs as `known_fails` in `submission.yml`. Write `none` if the run is clean.

| Check | Why it stays |
| --- | --- |
| | |

### 9.2 Original and improved suites

| Measure | First suite | Improved suite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executed / passed / failed | | |
| Requirements with meaningful tests (AC IDs and gaps) | | |
| Selected mutants detected | | |
| Accepted / revised / rejected tests | | |
| Remaining limitations | | |

### 9.3 What no AC decides

Call your function with `bookings = [{ start: 700, end: 650 }]` (a reversed existing booking)
and a request of 660–720. What does it return? Does any AC say what it should return? (This is
the value you declare in `submission.yml` under `assumptions.invalid_existing_booking`.)

## 10. Conclusion (120–180 words)

<!-- Answer all three in your own words, without the assistant:
     (a) Which mistake in the FIRST suite would have let a wrong canBook pass, and how did you find it?
     (b) What does your final green run prove, and what does it NOT prove? Use a mutant or a UI check.
     (c) One testing limitation that remains.
     Worthless: "The AI wrote good tests and they all passed."
     Worth everything: "The first suite expected T06 (exactly 120 minutes) to be rejected. That
     contradicts AC2, and it failed on a correct canBook. If I had changed the code to make it
     pass, M1 would have become the real behaviour." -->
